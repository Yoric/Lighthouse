Currently a sandbox for ongoing experiments in making written text easier to access by blind people.

For the moment, experiments focus on algorithms to locate and extract text from images recorded by a smartphone-quality or a webcam-quality, remove textures, backgrounds, light effects, ... and produce something that can be fed to an OCR software such as Tesseract.
